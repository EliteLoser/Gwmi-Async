# Gwmi-Async

Svendsen Tech's Gwmi-Async.ps1, available for download/clone here, is a "wrapper" around Get-WmiObject. It is designed to retrieve and collect data from a (potentially large) list of computers. You get an XML file parser based on the schema used, that simplifies creating custom PowerShell objects or CSV data that you can process, from the XML that the aforementioned script creates. A custom XML parser that's very flexible goes with it.

Online blog documentation here: https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/Get-wmiobject_wrapper - It's comprehensive to reproduce it here on GitHub.
